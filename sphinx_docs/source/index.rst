iSAM2: Incremental Smoothing and Mapping 2
==========================================

What is iSAM2
-------------
iSAM2 (Incremental Smoothing and Mapping) is a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm used to construct a map of the track from the car's position and the cones observed around the track. iSAM2 does this by constructing a factor graph using variables nodes (which represent either landmark poses or car poses) and factor nodes.
